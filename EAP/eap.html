    <h3>The Poe Museum</h3>
    <p>
      The Poe Museum provides a retreat into early nineteenth century Richmond
      where Edgar Allan Poe lived and worked. The museum features the life and
      career of Edgar Allan Poe by documenting his accomplishments with
      pictures, relics, and verse, and focusing on his many years in Richmond.
      Opened in 1922, in The Old Stone House, the museum is only blocks away
      from Poe's first Richmond home and his first place of employment, the
      Southern Literary Messenger.

        I would define, in brief, the Poetry of words as the Rhythmical Creation
        of Beauty.<br />
        Its sole arbiter is Taste.

      <p>
        Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering,
        fearing,<br />
        Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dreamed before.

      <p>
        The skies they were ashen and sober;<br />
        The leaves they were crisped and sere - The leaves they were withering
        and sere;<br />
        It was night in the lonesome October,<br />
        Of my most immemorial year.

      days after a drink at a birthday party on his way to visit his new fianc√©e
      in Richmond. He turned up in a delirious condition in a Baltimore gutter
      and died on October 7, 1849.
