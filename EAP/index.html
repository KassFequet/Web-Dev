        <h3>A Brief History</h3>
        <p>
          Edgar Allan Poe, son of Actress <span class="ITtext">Eliza Poe</span> and Actor <span class="ITtext">David Poe Jr.</span>,
          born 19th of January 1809, was mostly known for his poems and short
          tales and his literary criticism. He has been given credit for
          inventing the detective story and his psychological thrillers have
          been influences for many writers worldwide.

        <h3>The Poe Museum</h3>
        <p>
          The <a href="http://www.poemuseum.org/index.php"target="_blank"
            >Poe Museum</a> 
          provides a retreat into early nineteenth century
          Richmond where Edgar Allan Poe lived and worked. The museum features
          the life and career of Edgar Allan Poe by documenting his
          accomplishments with pictures, relics, and verse, and focusing on his
          many years in Richmond. Opened in 1922, in The Old Stone House, the
          museum is only blocks away from Poe's first Richmond home and his
          first place of employment, the Southern Literary Messenger.

            I would define, in brief, the Poetry of words as the Rhythmical
            Creation of Beauty.<br />

            Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering,
            fearing,<br />
            Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dreamed before.

            The skies they were ashen and sober;<br />
            The leaves they were crisped and sere - The leaves they were
            withering and sere;<br />
            It was night in the lonesome October,<br />
            Of my most immemorial year.

          Poe suffered from bouts of depression and madness, and he attempted
          suicide in 1848. In September the following year he disappeared for
          three days after a drink at a birthday party on his way to visit his
          new fianc√©e in Richmond. He turned up in a delirious condition in a
          <a href="http://www.baltimorecity.gov/" target=_blank">Baltimore</a> gutter and died on October 7, 1849.
