          <h3>Geographical Information</h3>
          <p class="blackparagraph">
            <span class="dropcap">T</span>he province consists of two sections, the island of
            <span class="varietytext">Newfoundland</span>, and the mainland
            portion of <span class="varietytext">Labrador</span>. The most
            easterly Canadian province, the island is situated at the mouth of
            the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The province lies between the 46th and
            61st parallels.

        <h3>Exploration History</h3>
        <p>
          The first European contact with North America was that of the medieval
          Norse settlers arriving via Greenland. For several years after AD 1000
          they lived in a village on the tip of the Great Northern Peninsula,
          known today as L'Anse aux Meadows. Remnants and artifacts of the
          occupation can still be seen at L'Anse aux Meadows, now a UNESCO World
          Heritage Site. The island was inhabited by the Beothuk (known as
          skrælingjar in Greenlandic Norse) and later by Mi'kmaq.
        </p>

        <p>
          From the late 15th Century, European explorers like John Cabot, João
          Fernandes Lavrador, Gaspar Corte-Real, Jacques Cartier and others
          began exploration.
        </p>

        <p>
          John Cabot (1450-1499), commissioned by King Henry VII of England,
          landed on the North East coast of North America in 1497. The exact
          location of his landing is unknown but the 500th anniversary of his
          landing was commemorated in Bonavista. The 1497 voyage has generated
          much debate among historians, with various points in
          <span class="varietytext">Newfoundland</span>, and Cape Breton Island
          in Nova Scotia, most often identified as the likely landing place.

            is found primarily in bogs and marshland throughout the province. It
            has a large wine-red flower and hollow pitcher-shaped leaves are
            attached to the base of the stem. An insectivorous plant, it feeds
            off insects that become trapped inside when the leaves fill with

          Designated as the provincial tree in November 1993, it is also known
          as the bog spruce. Although dark bluish-green in color, it is called
          the "black" spruce to distinguish it from other types of spruce trees.
          An evergreen coniferous tree, it is tolerant of nutrient-deficient
          soils, growing primarily in areas that have poor drainage. The

          has officially been the provincial bird of
          <span class="varietytext">Newfoundland and Labrador</span> since 1991.
          It is a member of the auk family. The puffin is also called the sea
          parrot because of its multi-colored beak. Marine birds that inhabit
          cliffs, puffins can dive 50 meters underwater in search of food. Their
          diet consists mostly of small fish such as caplin and herring. Their
          wingspan is approximately 55 cm., and they can fly up to 80 km. per
          hour. They live approximately 25 years, usually mate for life, and
          produce one egg per year. Witless Bay,
          <span class="varietytext">Newfoundland</span>, is home to the largest
          puffin colony in North America.

          A mineral discovered in northern
          <span class="varietytext">Labrador</span>, it was first described by
          Moravian missionaries in the late 18th century and brought to Europe.
          It is prized for its beautiful shifting iridescent colors of blue,
          green, grey and bronze. Found largely in the Nain area of
          <span class="varietytext">Labrador</span>, it is being mined at Ten
          Mile Bay by the <span class="varietytext">Labrador</span> Inuit
          Association.

          The provincial tartan was developed in 1955 by Sam Wilansky, a
          clothing store owner in St. John's. The tartan is predominantly green
          with gold, white, brown and red bands of color. He chose most of the
          colors to correspond with
