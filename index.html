        <h3>In The Beginning ...</h3>
        <p>
          The history of computers starts out about 2000 years ago, with the
          birth of the abacus. When the beads on the abacus are moved around,
          according to programming rules memorized by the user, all regular
          arithmetic problems can be done. In 1671, Gottfried Wilhelm von
          Leibniz invented a computer that was built in 1694. It could add, and,
          after changing some things around, multiply. About a century later
          Thomas of Colmar created the first successful mechanical calculator
          that could add, subtract, multiply, and divide.

            <li>
              In 1812, Babbage realized that many long calculations were really
              a series of predictable actions that were constantly repeated. He
              began to design an automatic mechanical calculating machine, which
              he called a difference engine.

              Herman Hollerith and James Powers made a step towards automated
              computing with the development of punched cards. Reading errors
              were reduced dramatically, workflow increased, and stacks of
              punched cards could be used as memory of almost unlimited size.
              For more than 50 years, punched card machines did most of the
              world's first business computing.

          <p>
            <li>
              The start of World War II produced a large need for computer
              capacity. In 1942, John P. Eckert and John W. Mauchly decided to
              build a high - speed electronic computer to do the job. Known as
              ENIAC, this machine could multiply two numbers at a rate of 300
              per second.

          <p>
            <li>
              Early in the 50's two important engineering discoveries changed
              the image of the computer field - Magnetic Core Memory and
              Transistor - Circuit Elements. These technical discoveries quickly
              found their way into computers. Such computers were mostly found
              in large computer centers operated by industry, government, and
              private laboratories.

          <p>
            <li>
              In the 1960's, efforts to design and develop the fastest possible
              computer with the greatest capacity reached a turning point with
              the Stretch computer by IBM. Stretch was made with the fastest
              access time, and total capacity in the vicinity of 100,000,000
              words.

          <p>
            <li>
              Many companies, some new to the computer field, introduced
              programmable minicomputers supplied with software packages in the
              1970's. The "shrinking" trend continued with the introduction of
              personal computers (PC's), which are programmable machines small
              enough and inexpensive enough to be purchased and used by
              individuals. Many companies, such as Apple Computer and Radio
              Shack introduced very successful PCs in the 1970's.
            </li>

          <p>
            <li>
              By the late 1980's, some personal computers were run by
              microprocessors that, handling 32 bits of data at a time, could
              process about 4,000,000 instructions per second.

              Computer networking, e-mail and the Internet, and electronic
              publishing are just a few of the applications that have grown in
              recent years. Computers continue to decrease in price, offering
              the promise that soon, “computers will reside in most homes,
              offices, and schools”.

        I chose to include two new tags, which are the details and summary tags.
        The details tag is used to hide and show content. The summary tag is
        used to make a visible heading for the details tag. With these tags I
        was able to make an interactive multiple choice question section.
